This website was created by [Johnny Noble](/00-09_site_administration/02_contact_and_feeds/02.01_contact_me)
in Canberra, Australia. The version you are reading is the 5th major version of
this site and it was created in early 2023.

Johnny.Decimal is just me. I tend to write this site in my back yard with my chickens. I came up with this idea in 2010, a story you should remind me to tell on the blog if I haven't already.

## Technical details

The site was hand-coded using [Astro](https://astro.build) and is hosted on [Netlify](https://netlify.com). I recommend both.

The delightful fixed-width typeface is [Berkeley Mono](https://berkeleygraphics.com/typefaces/berkeley-mono/), and the main typeface is [IBM Plex Sans](https://www.ibm.com/plex/).
