This is version `5.0.0` of the site. It was released on <time datetime="2022-02-05T12:00:00.000">2022-02-05 12:00 (AEST)</time>.

The site can be divided in to two sections: those areas that are 'version controlled', and those that are not.

The [changelog](/00-09_site_administration/01_about/01.05_changelog) will tell you what changed.

## Release cycle

Updates to version-controlled areas happen on a monthly cycle. I will publish updates as one single update to the site on or around the first weekend of the month.

The version number will update accordingly. [Semantic versioning](https://semver.org) is used:

- MAJOR, `5._._`: a total site re-write. I hope never to have to do this again.
- MINOR, `_.0._`: content updates. This number will increase when I do a monthly release.
- PATCH, `_._.0`: fixing errors: spelling mistakes, updating broken links. I'll make these changes as-needed.

## What's in version control

The following areas _are_ version controlled:

- [00-09 Site administration](/00-09_site_administration)
- [10-19 Concepts](/10-19_concepts)
- [20-29 Community](/20-29_community)
- [30-39 The library](/30-39_the_library)
- [40-49 Technology](/40-49_technology)

The following areas are _not_ version controlled:

- [50-59 The lab](/50-59_the_lab)
