But seriously. I have a normal job, which limits the time I can spend developing this thing. I'd _love_ for Johnny.Decimal to become the thing that pays the bills.

If you would like to support me -- no pressure, this will always be free, only do it if you can afford it -- here's how you can.

- [Sponsor me on GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/johnnydecimal)
- [Buy me a coffee on ko.fi](https://ko-fi.com/johnnydecimal)
- [Just give me a hundred dollars via Stripe](https://buy.stripe.com/bIY3dx4ph4BWedO000)<sup>1</sup>

## Interested in learning Excel?

My partner and I spent much of 2022 creating an Excel course. We think it's really good. I teach her -- a total Excel newbie -- how to use Excel. It's called ['Learn with Lucy'](https://www.learnwithlucy.rocks/courses/excel?coupon=johnnydecimal).

We spent ages planning the course. Everything she learned, she learned on camera. And now she can use Excel. So it works.

This is a bit more expensive, but you actually get something for your money. You can always buy this for a friend or family member.

It's normally US$195 (with various payment options -- see the site), but [here's a discount code ('JOHNNYDECIMAL')](https://www.learnwithlucy.rocks/courses/excel?coupon=johnnydecimal) that gives you 50% off.
