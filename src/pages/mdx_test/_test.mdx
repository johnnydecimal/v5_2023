# A test page so you can mount whatever here

Hmm but if this block isn't inheriting layout ... or is the point of Astro that things shouldn't worry about inheritance? Just have components with their own style?

Yeah that's how they want you to do it, so you can 'use low-specificity selectors' and so on. So let's stick with that.
