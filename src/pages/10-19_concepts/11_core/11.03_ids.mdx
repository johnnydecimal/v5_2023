import JDNumber from "@components/JDNumber/JDNumber.astro";

Let's get on to the decimal.

We have a category — let's say `22 Contracts` — and we want to store some things there.

We create a Johnny.Decimal number by adding a decimal point to our category, and starting at number `.01`.

We start at `.01` and not just `.1` because of the way that computers sort files. Also it's more consistent, and consistency is elegant.

<JDNumber margin="2rem 0" padding="1rem 1.6rem" size="2rem" text="22.01" />

Now we just decide what we're keeping there and give it a nice name.

<JDNumber
  margin="2rem 0"
  padding="1rem 1.6rem"
  size="2rem"
  text="22.01 Cleaning contract"
/>

Later, we need to store another contract. What to do? Just use the next number.

<JDNumber
  margin="2rem 0"
  padding="1rem 1.6rem"
  size="2rem"
  text="22.02 Office lease"
/>

## That was easy

You create a full Johnny.Decimal number by choosing a category and **looking for the next available number after the decimal.**

The thing to remember here is that the number after the decimal has _no meaning whatsoever:_ we just start at `.01` and work our way up.

## "What happens when I get to 99?"

You never will. And if you do, the category you defined was almost certainly too broad. Split it up.

## Give your Johnny.Decimal items simple names

This system lets us give concise names to things, because we already know from the number which category they're in.

I created `22.01 Cleaning contract` because it's short and reads well, but you could have gone with `22.01 Cleaning` if you'd preferred. You're already in a folder called `Contracts`.

**Everything that starts with** `22` **is a contract**.
