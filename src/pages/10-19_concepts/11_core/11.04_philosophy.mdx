# Philosophy

Before we go any further it's worth reinforcing the philosophy behind all of this. Because the numbers are great, but ... what was the point again?

## So that you can find your stuff

This is all a waste of time if it doesn't help you find your stuff quicker and with less stress than you can today.

**Nothing else matters.**

On [the forum](/20-29_community/21_forums_and_chat/21.01_the_forum) people often want to tweak the way they use their JD setup. I don't mind: use this as a guide and adapt it as you please.

But my core advice is always the same: do whatever you need to do _so that you can find your stuff again_.

# Why the 10 folders thing is important

We've all seen group drives at work that look something like this:

<div class="jd-box">
  <pre>{`.
├── _00 templates and important files
├── 00 Important
├── 01 Jim's temporary folder DO NOT MOVE
├── Accounts
├── Accounting
├── Expenses
├── Finance
├── FINANCE 2023
├── Group files
├── H drive backups for Finance team
└── Last year's accounts Jim copy of copy (2)`}</pre>
</div>
