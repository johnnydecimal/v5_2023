# Philosophy

Before we go any further it's worth reinforcing the philosophy behind all of this. Because the numbers are great, but ... what was the point again?

## So that you can find your stuff

This is all a waste of time if it doesn't help you find your stuff **quicker** and with **less stress** than you can today.

**Nothing else matters.**

On [the forum](/20-29_community/21_forums_and_chat/21.01_the_forum) people often want to tweak the way they use their JD setup. I don't mind: use this as a guide and adapt it as you please.

But my core advice is always the same: do whatever you need to do _so that you can find your stuff again_.

# Why the 10 folders thing is important

We've all seen group drives at work that look something like this. I've seen systems with _dozens_ of folders at the top level.

<JDBlock
  text={`
.
├─ _00 templates and important files
├─ 00 Important
├─ 01 Jim's temporary folder DO NOT MOVE
├─ Accounts
├─ Accounting
├─ Budget
├─ Drawings of products
├─ Expenses
├─ Final photos of products
├─ Finance
├─ FINANCE 2023
├─ Fred's project folder
├─ Group files
├─ H drive backups for Finance team
├─ Last year's accounts Jim copy of copy (2)
├─ Product photography
├─ ...
├─ x_archive
└─ x_DELETE ME
`}
  options={{
    classListForEveryLine: "hanging-3ch",
    ignoreLine: {
      2: true,
      4: true,
    },
  }}
/>

Anything could be anywhere! And it doesn't get better the deeper you go, it's chaos all the way down.

There is no chance of you finding anything in a system like this, and every chance that the thing you _do_ eventually find isn't the master version.

## J.D limits your choices

When you encounter a Johnny.Decimal system -- even one you've never seen before -- you are presented with, at most, ten choices: the **areas** that have been defined.

<JDBlock
  text={`
10-19 Finance and accounts
20-29 Products
30-39 ...and so on
`}
/>

Assuming your areas have been named sensibly, this makes it almost impossible to choose the wrong path. This applies whether you're opening or saving a file.

And when you go a level deeper, you're still limited to ten things.

<JDBlock
  text={`
10-19 Finance and accounts
   11 Budget
   12 Expenses
   13 Accounts
20-29 Products
   21 Drawings
   22 Photography
30-39 ...and so on
`}
/>

[ ] You can be sure that you're in the right place, and that you're not in the wrong place. In today's systems you might find anything anywhere. Not so in JD. And also if you want to be _sure_ that a thing exists without having to look for it first, use THE INDEX >.

# Setup time is repaid later

Setting this up is certainly not free from a time perspective. You need to plan and maintain your system. It doesn't manage itself.

But this time that you spend is paid back many times over by the reduction in friction _every time_ you go to open or save a file.
