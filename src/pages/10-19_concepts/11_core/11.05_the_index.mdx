# The index

[ ] Example: having your system spread across multiple domains. L43.16.12 will only be on DAFF/Outlook so you put that in the note and now you don't have to try to figure out where the hell it is.
[ ] Using Bear with Alfred's plugin: so now you're a quick `bs` away from finding any number.
[ ] Might be worth noting that this would be the focus of any software that you write. Can anyone help?
[ ] Call out that your index is for JD IDs only -- not what's in them. You don't index _every file_.
