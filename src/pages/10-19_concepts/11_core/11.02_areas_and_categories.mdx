Let's look again at the format of our numbers. It's crucial that you understand _why_ they look like they do.

## The complete Johnny.Decimal number

Just as a reminder, every Johnny.Decimal number looks like this.

<Areas1_random_numbers />

In words, we have any two digits, followed by a decimal point, followed by two more digits.

## Group things together (categories)

Johnny.Decimal is all about **grouping similar things together**, so let's start to do that.

<Areas2_group_them_together />

## Do it again (areas)

That's starting to look more like something organised and a bit less like a bunch of random numbers. Let's take it one step further.

<Areas3_do_it_again />

### Interesting...

<Areas4_interesting />

# Of course, we've done this backwards

When we decide to organise something with Johnny.Decimal, we don't _start_ with a bunch of numbers.

We start like this:

- First, we divide everything in our system in to (at most) ten large buckets of stuff. We call those our **areas**, and we assign each area a range like `10-19`, `20-29` … `90-99`.
- Then, within each area, we break things up again in to (at most) ten more buckets. We call them **categories** and we assign them numbers like `11`, `12` … `19`.
- Finally, we assign each individual thing in our system to a category, and give it a unique number. We start at `.01` within each category, and work our way up through the numbers.

Let's use a small company as an example, and write it out without the numbers.

<Areas5_small_company_step1 />

All we really do with Johnny.Decimal—and if at this point you've realised this and are thinking, "hang on, all he's done is put numbers in front of things," well then you're not far wrong—is put numbers in front of things<sup>1</sup>.

**But this transforms the way you think about and use everything.** Trust me.

Let's put numbers in front of the system we just built above.

<Areas6_small_company_step2 />

## So long, cursed alphabet

What does this achieve? For one, it's removed our dependence on the alphabet. The alphabet is a fine thing but it's a terrible way to sort your files because things move around. Today we have:

<Areas7_alphabetical_folders />

and tomorrow the exports department come along and do this:

<Areas8_new_exports_folder />

…and `Finance` isn't the second thing in the list any more. This sounds like a small thing, but <strong>it makes it impossible for your brain to learn where something will be.</strong>

## The Johnny.Decimal version

This is better:

<Areas9_this_is_better />

Because our folders all start with a number, they'll sort in very predictable way. This concept applies throughout the system.

## 20, 60, 30, 90?

At this point you might be wondering, well, why is `Finance` all of the numbers from `20-29` and why is `Exports` `40-49`? What do those numbers <em>mean</em>?

And the answer is that they mean nothing. They're just numbers. `40` isn't better or worse than `20`.

# In summary

On this page I've talked mostly about the way that we structure our areas and categories. By now you should have a good high-level understanding. You have categories of things and each category belongs to one area only. Areas group categories together.

All of this happens <em>before the decimal</em>. Those two digits of the number <strong>are the category</strong>, and the first digit of the number tells you which area it's in.

What we've done here is organise a bunch of 'stuff' in to something with structure; we've created, essentially, a very simple database.
