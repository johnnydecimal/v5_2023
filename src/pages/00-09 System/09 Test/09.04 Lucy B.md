# What do our components look like?

Think about them before you start to code. Map them out here.

# Navigation

It'll look pretty simple. A grid of items, square, with highlights on the active.

Don't worry about collapsing anything at this stage. That can be a v5.1 job.

But how will it be generated? Automatically, that's how. You add a page, it gets a new item.

You did this in the tutorial.

But you still need a component to render each of these. So it needs to accept props.

```js
props: {
	number: number;
	title: string;
	type: acid;
	active: Boolean;
}
```
