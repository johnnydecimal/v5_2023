> Strictly speaking, not an RFC 7231 compliant error code.

How ironic; a site dedicated to numbers, and you're seeing one. Entirely the wrong one -- 404 is the error code which means we couldn't find what you were looking for.

If you think there should be something here -- like if you clicked a link on this site and arrived here -- please contact me and I'll fix it. Thanks! :-)
