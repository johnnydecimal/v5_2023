# 04.04

> Strictly speaking, not an RFC 7231 compliant error code.

How ironic: a site dedicated to numbers, and you're seeing one. Entirely the wrong one -- `404` is the HTTP error code which means we couldn't find what you were looking for.

If you think there should be something here -- like if you clicked a link on this site and arrived here -- please [contact me](/00-09_site_administration/02_send_and_receive/02.01_contact_me) and I'll fix it. Thanks! :-)
