import JDFootnote from "../../components/JDFootnote/JDFootnote.astro";

# H1 header

With some text after it.

Headers have `font-family` at weight `600`. They have margin which is different depending whether they're `:first-child`.

They have a custom `line-height` and of course the border in lieu of underlines. We like that big fat border.

## H2 header

These sentences are in `div.jdcontent p` which has some `margin` applied top/bottom to space it out, `font-size` and `line-height`.

Note that `font-size` is `18`, the site default being `16`.

### H3 header

Words usually follow.

---

# First-level 0123456789

Which was preceded by a horizontal break.

---

This text is in Markdown backticks: `backticks`. That renders in `div.jdcontent p code`, which is Astro default behaviour.

We style that using `.jdcontent code` and that's where it gets the borders, colour, and a touch of `padding-inline`.

### `div.jdcontent`

Minimal styling. We give it some `margin` and set the `font-family`.

### Superscript

We can <sup>1</sup> use the `<sup>` tag and get superscript. You're controlling the size and font, and the browser is doing the rest.

### Lists

This is an ordered list:

1. First
2. Second
3. Third

And this is unordered:

- Last
- Middle
- First? Welp!

You've tweaked the `list-style` properties, and removed some padding.

### Links

Links! [This is a link](#) and it should have funky hover effects. [This is a link](http://localhost:3000) that you have visited.

### Images

Don't bother importing images using the `![]()` syntax. You can't control for 2x.

Instead just use a trusty `<img>` tag, and specify the image in `srcset` with ` 2x` at the end.

<img
  alt="Test"
  src="/img/11.01_finder_sample_company_expanded.png"
  srcset="/img/11.01_finder_sample_company_expanded.png 2x"
/>

They get a border, some padding, a shadow, and they're centered using `margin: auto`. Do you really want them centered by default?

You should probably be serving 1x images as `src` but you're not.

### Footnotes

We reference a footnote<sup>1</sup> with a regular `<sup>`, then pass `number` and `text` to `<JDFootnote />`.

The browser's styles take care of the superscript, and we make the font smaller.

<JDFootnote
  number="1"
  text="Like this one. It flows nicely on to multiple lines, which is always nice."
/>

# One-offs

`11.01` and `11.03` contain large JD numbers. And of course, wrap them in `<p>` not `<div>`!

`<p class="large-number">AC.ID</p>`:

<p class="large-number">`AC.ID`</p>

The CSS for this is in section 'one-offs' in johnny.scss.

Not going to duplicate them here. They're on:
