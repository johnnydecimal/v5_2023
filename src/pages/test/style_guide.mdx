# H1 header

With some text after it.

Headers have `font-family` at weight `600`. They have margin which is different depending whether they're `:first-child`.

They have a custom `line-height` and of course the border in lieu of underlines. We like that big fat border.

## H2 header

These sentences are in `div.jdcontent p` which has some `margin` applied top/bottom to space it out, `font-size` and `line-height`.

Note that `font-size` is `18`, the site default being `16`.

### H3 header

Words usually follow.

---

# First-level 0123456789

Which was preceded by a horizontal break.

---

This text is in Markdown backticks: `backticks`. That renders in `div.jdcontent p code`, which is Astro default behaviour.

We style that using `.jdcontent code` and that's where it gets the borders, colour, and a touch of `padding-inline`.

### `div.jdcontent`

Minimal styling. We give it some `margin` and set the `font-family`.
