import JDBlock from "@components/jd/JDBlock.astro";

# What do our components look like?

Think about them before you start to code. Map them out here.

# Navigation

It'll look pretty simple. A grid of items, square, with highlights on the active.

Don't worry about collapsing anything at this stage. That can be a v5.1 job.

But how will it be generated? Automatically, that's how. You add a page, it gets a new item.

You did this in the tutorial.

<JDBlock
	jdSystem={`
20-29 PMP
   20 Integration
	 21 Scope
	    21.01 Scope management plan
	 22 Cost
	    22.01 Cost management plan
`}
/>

But you still need a component to render each of these. So it needs to accept props.

<JDBlock
	jdSystem={`
30-39 Hi Lucy
31 Great
31.45 AMazing
31.68 Best
`}
/>
