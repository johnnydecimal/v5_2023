/**
	# JDNavItem

	A component which renders the items which make up the JD-tree navigation bar.

	Each might be an area, category, or ID. It might be active, or not.

	They're probably going to end up being grid items but just add that as a CSS class later. (Although what's wrong with a bunch of <div>s?)

	# Constructing it
	So a JDNavItem is just a box with some text in it.

	If the item is an Area, just display {number} {title}.
	If it's a Category, indent by 3 spaces {'   '}.
	If it's an ID, indent by 6 spaces {'      '}.

	It links to the page that it represents.

interface Props {
	number: string; // For display
	title: string; // For display
	acid: "area" | "category" | "id"; // For indentation
	active: boolean; // So we can temporarily disable stuff; default to `true`
	// TODO: fix the 'any' typing here
	url: any; // So we can use it in an <a href>
}
