# Spitballing how we develop the navbar and the where-you-are-bar.

## Everything

When we reach the active ID, we stop drawing completely.

IF `after the active ID`
  insert spaces according to acid;
  break;

## Areas

It's either the active area or it isn't.

If it is, it's a colour. That's just CSS.

Otherwise areas don't get involved with the whole where-you-are-bar situation.

## Categories

IF `active`
  `└┤&nbsp;&nbsp;`
ELSE
  `│&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`
  
And this works even for the first category, everything is consistent.
